# Models

Each model used by the simulation: what it computes, its parameters, its assumptions, and how far it has been validated. A model is documented in the commit that adds it. Status values are `unit-tested` (behavior checked against analytic results), `validated` (compared with external data), or `placeholder` (values chosen without a source).

## Conventions

- SI units: meters, seconds, radians.
- World frame is right-handed with +z up. Yaw is rotation about +z, counter-clockwise, 0 along +x.
- Gravity is `(0, 0, -9.81)` m/s^2. The dynamics model ignores it (thrust compensates); the IMU model accounts for it.
- The Unreal plugin converts to Unreal's left-handed centimeter coordinates at its boundary. The core never uses Unreal units.

## Drone dynamics

Source: `core/sim/include/swarm/dynamics.hpp`. Status: unit-tested.

A kinematic point mass with a yaw angle. There is no attitude, thrust, drag, or motor model.

Per step of `dt` seconds, with command acceleration `a_c`:

```
a  = clamp_norm(a_c, max_accel)
v' = clamp_norm(v + a*dt, max_speed)
p' = p + v'*dt
accel_applied = (v' - v)/dt
yaw_rate' = clamp(yaw_rate_command, -max_yaw_rate, max_yaw_rate)
yaw' = wrap(yaw + yaw_rate'*dt)            wrapped into (-pi, pi]
```

This is semi-implicit Euler. For constant acceleration the position error against the continuous solution is `0.5*a*dt*t`, first order in `dt`; tests check the exact discrete closed form.

| Parameter | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `max_speed` | 15 m/s | Speed limit, direction preserved |
| `max_accel` | 8 m/s^2 | Acceleration limit, direction preserved |
| `max_yaw_rate` | pi rad/s | Yaw rate limit |

Limitations: no vertical-specific limits, no wind, no ground contact. Collision with terrain and obstacles is handled by control in a later phase.
